    "effect": "Like all godswords, the Armadyl godsword has a special attack , The Judgement . In addition to doubled accuracy, it inflicts damage with a 37.5% higher maximum hit than a normal attack (125% multiplied by the hidden 110% every godsword special possesses, the calculation uses integer values after the multiplication of 1.1 the value gets rounded down and then multiplied by 1.25), consuming 50% of the player's special attack energy. The Judgement rolls against the opponent's slash defence roll. The Judgement is capable of dealing a very large amount of damage; under ideal conditions, a player can potentially deal over 70 damage to a monster with the special attack, or just over 90 damage when utilising the effects of a black mask or a Castle wars bracelet . Because of this, the Armadyl godsword is very popular for many combat situations. In PvP scenarios the Armadyl godsword is most commonly used as a \"knock-out\" weapon, as the special is often capable of finishing an injured player in one large blow. In PvM scenarios its high hits are advantageous when fighting boss monsters such as General Graardor , especially when several players are competing to deal the most damage in order to secure a drop. The special attack animation 's colours can be changed to gold, which costs 75 Last Man Standing points. Once unlocked, the gold trim can be toggled at Justine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing whenever the player desires.",
