OSRS DPS Calculator

A comprehensive damage-per-second calculator for Old School RuneScape with accurate combat formulas, equipment comparison, and boss statistics.


Overview

The OSRS DPS Calculator is a powerful tool for Old School RuneScape players to optimize their combat gear and strategies. By accurately implementing the game's combat formulas, this calculator helps players compare different equipment setups, account for special effects, and calculate expected damage against various bosses.

Technical Documentation
Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js and uses:

    Zustand for state management
    TanStack Query for data fetching
    shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for styling
    TypeScript for type safety

State Persistence

The calculator remembers your last selected boss, locked gear, and loadout across
page reloads using Zustand's `persist` middleware. Boss and item lists are cached
locally for 12 hours so returning to the app doesn't require refetching all
reference data.

Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and uses:

    Azure SQL Database for persistent storage
    Pydantic for data validation
    Custom calculators for combat style-specific logic
    Data scrapers for maintaining up-to-date game information

Combat Formulas

The calculator implements the following OSRS combat formulas:

Melee:

Effective Strength = floor((Strength Level √ó Prayer Bonus) + Style Bonus + 8)
Max Hit = floor(0.5 + Effective Strength √ó (Strength Bonus + 64) / 640)

Ranged:

Effective Ranged = floor((Ranged Level √ó Prayer Bonus) + Style Bonus + 8)
Max Hit = floor(0.5 + Effective Ranged √ó (Ranged Strength + 64) / 640)

Magic:

Effective Magic = floor((Magic Level √ó Prayer Bonus) + Style Bonus + 8)
Max Hit = floor(Base Spell Hit √ó (1 + Magic Damage Bonus))

Hit Chance:

If Attack Roll > Defence Roll:
  Hit Chance = 1 - (Defence Roll + 2) / (2 √ó (Attack Roll + 1))
Else:
  Hit Chance = Attack Roll / (2 √ó (Defence Roll + 1))

DPS:

DPS = Hit Chance √ó ((Max Hit + 1) / 2) / Attack Speed

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file inside the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env.local
```

For production, set this to your deployed API URL. The deployment workflows
expect a repository secret named `BACKEND_URL` which will be exposed as
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` during the frontend build.
Ensure this secret contains the URL of your deployed FastAPI service, for example
`https://scapelab-api-dvawaebtdze3brf0.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net`.

When deploying the frontend, the workflow also requires a secret named
`AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_YELLOW_STONE_0DAF36A0F` containing the
deployment token for your Azure Static Web App.
Database Setup

The backend now connects directly to an Azure SQL Database. Configure the
connection string using the `SQLAZURECONNSTR_DefaultConnection` environment
variable or provide the individual parameters:

    AZURE_SQL_SERVER
    AZURE_SQL_DATABASE
    AZURE_SQL_USERNAME
    AZURE_SQL_PASSWORD

When running in Azure App Service you can omit the username and password and
authenticate via Managed Identity.

The scraper utilities still produce SQLite databases. Use
`webscraper/runescape-items/migrate_sql_to_azure.py` to import this data into
the Azure SQL instance.

The API also caches boss and item lookups in memory. Set the
`CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable to control how long (in seconds)
these results remain cached. The default is `3600` seconds. On the first
request the server loads and caches the full boss and item lists, and all
subsequent search requests are served from this in-memory cache so the
database is only queried when a specific record is requested.

Database connections are pooled. Tune pool behaviour with the following
environment variables:

- `DB_POOL_SIZE` ‚Äì Maximum number of open connections (default `5`).
- `DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` ‚Äì Connection timeout in seconds (default `30`).
- `DB_MAX_RETRIES` ‚Äì Number of connection retries for transient failures
  (default `3`).

Performance & API Best Practices
-------------------------------

- Use `page` and `page_size` on `/items` and `/bosses` to paginate responses and minimize payload size.
- Item and boss detail endpoints utilise server-side in-memory caches. Responses include a `Cache-Control` header with a `max-age` matching the `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` setting.
- Adjust cache duration via the `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable when launching the backend.

See the API documentation at /docs for more endpoints.
