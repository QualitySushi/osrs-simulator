Technical Documentation
Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js and uses:

    Zustand for state management
    TanStack Query for data fetching
    shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for styling
    TypeScript for type safety

Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and uses:

    SQLite for database storage
    Pydantic for data validation
    Custom calculators for combat style-specific logic
    Data scrapers for maintaining up-to-date game information

Combat Formulas

The calculator implements the following OSRS combat formulas:

Melee:

Effective Strength = floor((Strength Level √ó Prayer Bonus) + Style Bonus + 8)
Max Hit = floor(0.5 + Effective Strength √ó (Strength Bonus + 64) / 640)

Ranged:

Effective Ranged = floor((Ranged Level √ó Prayer Bonus) + Style Bonus + 8)
Max Hit = floor(0.5 + Effective Ranged √ó (Ranged Strength + 64) / 640)

Magic:

Effective Magic = floor((Magic Level √ó Prayer Bonus) + Style Bonus + 8)
Max Hit = floor(Base Spell Hit √ó (1 + Magic Damage Bonus))

Hit Chance:

If Attack Roll > Defence Roll:
  Hit Chance = 1 - (Defence Roll + 2) / (2 √ó (Attack Roll + 1))
Else:
  Hit Chance = Attack Roll / (2 √ó (Defence Roll + 1))

DPS:

DPS = Hit Chance √ó ((Max Hit + 1) / 2) / Attack Speed

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the root directory:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

For production, set this to your deployed API URL. The deployment workflows
expect a repository secret named `BACKEND_URL` which will be exposed as
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` during the frontend build.
Database Setup

The application uses two SQLite databases:

    osrs_combat_items.db: Equipment data
    osrs_bosses.db: Boss data

These databases can be generated using the provided scrapers:

bash

python osrs_item_scraper.py
python extract.py

The GitHub workflow `generate-databases.yml` runs these scrapers weekly and
uploads the resulting `.db` files as artifacts.
