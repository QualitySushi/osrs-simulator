The Judgement is capable of dealing a very large amount of damage; under ideal conditions, a player can potentially deal over 70 damage to a monster with the special attack, or just over 90 damage when utilising the effects of a black mask or a Castle wars bracelet . Because of this, the Armadyl godsword is very popular for many combat situations. In PvP scenarios the Armadyl godsword is most commonly used as a \"knock-out\" weapon, as the special is often capable of finishing an injured player in one large blow. In PvM scenarios its high hits are advantageous when fighting boss monsters such as General Graardor , especially when several players are competing to deal the most damage in order to secure a drop.

  {
    "weapon_name": "Burning claws",
    "effect": "The burning claws have a special attack , Burning barrage , which drains 30% of the player's special attack energy. Burning barrage hits an enemy three times in succession, rolling against the opponent's slash or stab defence (depending on the combat style used). Each of the three hits also has a chance to inflict a burn on the target, dealing a total of 10 damage over the course of 40 ticks (24 seconds). Burn effects can be stacked with each other up to a cap of five active burns. One spec can inflict 0, 10, 19, 20, or 29 burn damage, taking 40-44 ticks depending on the case. The chance to inflict a burn on each hitsplat scales based on which of the attack's three accuracy rolls is the first to succeed: 15% if the first roll succeeds, 30% if the second roll succeeds, and 45% if the third rolls succeeds. Burning barrage works as follows: Roll accuracy. If successful, roll total damage between 75% and 175% of the maximum hit. Divide the damage into three hitsplats as 25%-25%-50%. Each hitsplat has a 15% chance to inflict burn. If first roll misses, reroll accuracy. If successful, roll total damage between 50% and 150% of the maximum hit. Divide the damage into three hitsplats as 50%-50%-0%, then subtract 1 from the first two hitsplats and add that damage to the third hitsplat (e.g., a total roll of 16 becomes 7-7-2). Each hitsplat has a 30% chance to inflict burn. If the second roll misses, reroll accuracy. If successful, roll total damage between 25% and 125% of the maximum hit. Divide the damage into three hitsplats as 0%-0%-100%, then subtract 2 from the third hitsplat and add 1 to each of the other two hitsplats (e.g., a total roll of 9 becomes 1-1-7). Each hitsplat has a 45% chance to inflict burn. If all three accuracy rolls miss, there is a 20% chance of dealing 0 damage, a 40% chance of dealing 1 damage, and a 40% chance of dealing 2 damage. These hits cannot inflict burn. All of the minimum and maximum hit calculations are rounded down, and the individual hitsplats are rounded down as well. For example, for a normal maximum hit of 39, the minimum and maximum hits for the first accuracy roll case are calculated as floor(0.75 * 39) and floor(1.75 * 39), resulting in a damage range of 29-68. If 29 damage is rolled, the hitsplats are calculated as floor(0.25 * 29), floor(0.25 * 29), and floor(0.5 * 29), resulting in a hit of 7-7-14\u2014a total of 28 actual damage, despite originally rolling for 29 damage.",

    "effect": "The crystal halberd shares the same special attack as the dragon halberd , consuming 30% of the player's special attack energy. In addition to a 10% damage boost, if used against \"large\" monsters (anything that is larger than 1x1, such as General Graardor ), the special attack will deal an additional second hit onto them, although with 25% reduced accuracy. It can also hit up to 10 NPCs in a multi-combat area in a 3x1 area centred on the main target (unless it used on an NPC larger than 1x1, in which case it will hit the target twice and ignore the rest of the NPCs). In PvP , it can only hit up to three players. The crystal halberd's special attack's accuracy rolls against the opponent's slash defence. [1] When using gear with the highest strength bonus and a Slayer helmet or black mask on task, the highest possible hit with the special attack is 78\u201378 (total of 156) on large monsters. While this is higher than what dragon claws and dragon dagger can achieve, the much slower attack speed of the halberd is a major downside, so the claws and dagger generally lead to faster damage output in combat. The crystal halberd's special attack can still be particularly useful in certain situations. Anywhere that players have a forced amount of downtime (time where it is impossible to continue attacking), a crystal halberd special attack can be substituted for extra damage without incurring the 7-tick penalty. This is a common tactic against the Pestilent Bloat ; due to his long period of time where you have to run away, players typically use a crystal halberd special attack as their last damaging attack before running away to increase their potential damage cap. In a similar manner, it is often used when the opponent is on low health and the special attack is likely to finish them faster than using standard weapons (a strategy known as \"last-hitting\"). Although halberds are the only weapon category alongside spears to ignore the damage reduction on the Corporeal Beast , the crystal halberd has limited use on it; as the special attack rolls against the opponent's slash defence, which is particularly high on the Corporeal Beast, it is very inaccurate against it (typically to the point where dragon claws are more effective despite the damage reduction) unless its Defence level is severely reduced. The special attack's ability to hit up to ten enemies can prove useful as well; when on a Slayer task where stacking enemies up in one pile to cast multi-combat spells is efficient, such as smoke devils , the crystal halberd can deal a large amount of additional damage, often twice that of an Ice Barrage . It is often used for this purpose in efficient Barbarian Assault teams by the attacker.",

If all stats are equal, it will drain both Attack and Strength, then Ranged, or Magic. This special attack is useful for players in a multicombat area to attack multiple monsters simultaneously to get their attention, such as for dust devils and greater nechryael in the Catacombs of Kourend ; as the special attack is considered a melee attack against all affected monsters, it can be useful to use in tandem with the serpentine helm due to its passive chance to inflict venom on hit.",

    "effect": "The dragon battleaxe has a special attack , Rampage ; when toggled, the player character immediately hefts the weapon above their head and bellows Raarrrrrgggggghhhhhhh! , consuming 100% of their special attack energy. This drains the player's Attack , Defence , Ranged , and Magic levels by 10%, while increasing their Strength level by 10 + (levels drained / 4), rounded down. The strength boost is comparable to that of a super strength potion. However, depending on the player's combat levels and pre-existing boosts, it can raise Strength by up to 21. Barring overload potions or an imbued heart, doing this requires a minimum of 97 Ranged and 96 Magic, as well as 99 Attack and 92 Defence (or vice versa if the player chooses to drink a saradomin brew). Players can then drink a Zamorak brew , super restore , super defence , ranging potion and magic potion before using the dragon battleaxe special attack to have more levels drained, which in turn increases the Strength boost. This allows players with 99 Strength to reach 120, the highest possible in the game outside the Tombs of Amascut . The special attack providing an unlimited amount of Strength boosts accounts for the popularity of this weapon; although the weapon itself is seldom used in combat, it is entirely possible to use Rampage for a strength boost and then revert to a primary melee weapon. The drained stats can be recovered using a restore potion , or an attack / super attack potion if only melee damage output is a concern. In order to make full use of the special attack without boosts, your Attack, Defence, Ranged and Magic need to be at 90, using the special attack will reduce each by 9 points which will raise your Strength by 19 points (10+reduction/4). Alternatively, drinking from a fancy / ornate rejuvenation pool effectively eliminates the stat drain and special energy cost of Rampage while retaining the Strength boost. The Pool of Refreshment in Ferox Enclave will reset both boosts and drains, so it cannot be used for this purpose.",

    "weapon_name": "Dragon claws",
    "effect": "These claws feature a special attack , Slice and Dice , which drains 50% of the special attack bar and hits an enemy four times in succession, which is commonly used by PKers as a finisher. The damage calculation rolls against the opponent's slash defence. [1] The damage dealt by the special attack depends on which of the four strikes miss. All fractions described below are rounded down. Due to a lack of sources, there may be minor errors in this description: Each of the four attacks has the same accuracy as an ordinary attack, until one of the attacks manages to successfully hit. After an attack hits, all remaining attacks will also successfully hit the target. All successful hits will deal damage, as described below. \"4-2-1-1\" . If the first attack hits, then its max hit will be 1 point less than the max hit of an ordinary attack. The minimum hit will be half of the ordinary max hit. The second hit will deal half of the first hit. The third hit will deal half of the second. The fourth hit will deal 1 more damage than the third hit. [2] A realistic example of a full attack is 35\u201317\u20138\u20139. \"0-4-2-2\" . If the first hit is 0 and the second one hits, then the second hit will deal between about 3/8 and 7/8 of the ordinary maximum hit. The remaining hits will follow the same process as above. An example of this situation is 0\u201330\u201315\u201316. \"0-0-3-3\" . If the first two attacks hit 0\u20130, the third attack will deal between about 1/4 and 3/4 of the ordinary max hit. The fourth hit still matches the third hit as usual. For example, 0\u20130\u201322\u201323. \"0-0-0-5\" . If the claws' first 3 hits are zeros, the last hit (if successful) will deal between 1/4 and 5/4 the ordinary max hit. e.g.: 0\u20130\u20130\u201346. \"0-0-0-0\" . If all hits miss, there is a ~2/3 chance of dealing 2 damage (1-1-0-0, 0-0-1-1, 1-0-1-0, or 0-1-0-1) and a ~1/3 chance of hitting 0\u20130\u20130\u20130. The shorthand names, like \"4-2-1-1\", give a rough idea of the total damage dealt, but are not fully accurate. The expected total damage is as follows [3] : If all attacks hit, the damage dealt is between 1x and 2x the ordinary max hit. This is 3 times more damage, on average, than an ordinary successful hit. If the second strike is the first to hit, the total is between 0.75x and 1.75x of the ordinary max hit, or about 2.5x of the ordinary successful hit. If the third strike is the first to hit, the total is between 0.5x and 1.5x of the ordinary max hit, or about 2x of the ordinary successful hit. If the fourth strike is the first to hit, the total is between 0.25x and 1.25x of the ordinary max hit, or about 1.5x of the ordinary successful hit. Against a weak enemy, where a hit is nearly guaranteed, a special attack from the dragon claws will deal about 3x as much as a normal attack. Against an enemy with extremely high defence, where most or all player attacks will typically miss, the expected damage can scale to as high as 9x the damage of a normal attack, because the repeated accuracy checks give a high chance of hitting an opponent that is normally very resistant. In practice, against most bosses, the average damage will be somewhere in between. For example, if the player has 50% accuracy with claws at a certain boss, then the special attack does as much damage on average as about five normal attacks. If the player is on a Slayer task (and using a Slayer helmet or Black mask ) wearing maximum strength gear, the highest possible hit sequence is 49\u201324\u201312\u201313, totalling up to 98 . Against players, the highest sequence is 44-22-11-12, totalling up to 89 . Although dragon dagger can hit higher (up to 108 and 100 respectively), its special attack rolls the two hits independently and it is less accurate, making high hits less consistent. Similarly, while crystal halberd can also hit very high in one special attack against a large monster, its slower attack speed and independent rolls make it perform worse on average.",

It pushes an opponent back and stuns them for 6 ticks (3.6 seconds), consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy. Furthermore, the special attack delays the next attack one can perform to 5 ticks (3.0 seconds) compared to the normal attack speed of 4 ticks (2.4seconds). The effects of this special do not stack, meaning that players cannot use the spear's special attack on a target who is already stunned. Stunned players are also given a one tick (0.6 seconds) period of immunity after a stun wears off in which they cannot be stunned again. This effectively means the special attack cannot be used on the same player more than once every 6 ticks. In addition to this, as soon as the stun wears off, the stunned player is also granted a 5 tick (3.0 seconds) period of immunity against being bound in place by binding spells like Entangle or Ice Barrage . Despite this, the special attack is popular in player killing as the brief stun causes all incoming damage to be stalled until it expires, after which all damage taken is applied at once. Under certain conditions, Shove can push the target diagonally past obstacles. This only occurs when pushing a target east or west, and if there is a free tile directly north or south of the obstacle \u2014 e.g. 1x1 obstacles, the corner of larger ones, or diagonal walls. Targets will not be pushed past obstacles when pushing to the north or south. Shove displays a preference for certain tiles; when pushing a target east or west past a 1x1 obstacle, the north or south free tile will always be chosen, respectively. On non-Castle Wars worlds, players within Castle Wars are able to shove targets back-to-back using this special attack. [1] In addition, it cannot be used against large monsters, such as giants , because they are too big to push back. If a player tries this, the special attack does not occur and no special attack energy is consumed. A message appears in the chat box, reading, \"That creature is too large to knock back!\" A general way to tell if the spear can use the \"Shove\" special attack is to determine how much space the target monster takes up. If it takes up more than one space, it cannot be shoved. For example, a player can shove an ice warrior , which takes up one space, but not an ice giant , which takes up four.",

    "effect": "The dragon warhammer has a special attack , Smash , which deals 50% more damage, while lowering the target's current Defence level by 30% on successful hit (i.e. the hit has to deal damage). [1] This attack consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. Defence level reductions will stack over multiple successful hits; each reduction is calculated from the current temporary level (so follow-up drains reduce fewer levels). The Defence level of the target after each respective hit, with no rounding, would be 70%, 49%, 34.3%, 24%, 16.8% then 11.8% of the original. However, fractional defence levels reduced by the special attack will be rounded down. For example, on a monster with 75 Defence, the first special attack will reduce 22 levels (rounded down from 22.5), leaving the enemy at 53 Defence. The next special attack will then reduce 15 levels (rounded down from 15.6), leaving the enemy at 38 Defence. When used against Tekton , the first special attack from a dragon warhammer is guaranteed to hit [2] , however, if subsequent attack were to fail to hit, it will instead reduce 5% of his Defence level. The dragon warhammer special attack specialises in reducing high amounts of defence based on a percentage on any successful attack. Unlike other weapons such as the Bandos godsword , bone dagger or barrelchest anchor , the dragon warhammer only needs to roll a successful hit to reduce 30% of the monster's defence level. If a monster has level 300 defence, the dragon warhammer will always reduce its defence by 90 levels, always reducing more defence than the Bandos godsword. Following this, it will reduce defence by 63 levels. The lower the defence level of a monster, the less impactful a dragon warhammer will be, and more impactful the Bandos godsword will be. If fighting bosses with other players, using a mixture of both special weapons can drastically reduce defence levels as far down as 0.",

For example, kurasks can only be harmed by leaf-bladed weaponry, broad bolts , or the Magic Dart spell, but if Invocate would have otherwise hit a 40 before immunity, the restoration effect still takes place for 20 prayer points. This mechanic also applies if the target has less total health than the potential damage of the attack. If a target with only 2 hitpoints remaining is struck with an Invocate that would have dealt 60 damage, the attacker will still have 30 prayer points restored.",

    "effect": "The granite maul's special attack , Quick Smash , consumes 60% of the player's special attack energy and deals an instant attack. This is reduced to 50% when using a granite maul (ornate handle) . With the handle added, the special attack can result in two or three hits in a very short amount of time, making it a popular choice for player killing . If the three hits are timed correctly, the granite maul can kill instantly. However, one drawback is that unlike most special attacks, Quick Smash does not increase accuracy. It is commonly used in the Nightmare Zone in conjunction with the Power surge power-up. Because Quick Smash can be performed rapidly under the effect of Power surge, the granite maul is able to put out more total damage than other special attacks for as long as the power-up is active. The granite maul's special attack has a feature where, for 5 ticks after attacking a target with any weapon, activating the granite maul's special attack while next to that target will automatically attack it without clicking to do so. Clicking the special attack bar toggles the activation and reactivation of this feature, so clicking the special attack bar twice, for example, will disable the automatic attack. Clicking on the special attack bar twice does not disable the granite maul special attack. Rather, it initiates a 3 tick timer during which clicking on an opponent (or clicking the special attack bar a third time while next to an opponent one has attacked within 5 ticks) will cause two special attacks to occur if possible, or one if it is not. Once it has been activated, a granite maul special attack can only be disabled by taking off the weapon, or waiting out this 3 tick timer. The game displays a warning when the player initiates combat with a granite maul special attack, calling it wasteful. However, the special attack does not give the player any attack cooldown, regardless of if it was used to initiate combat or not. This means that initiating combat with a granite maul special attack can be quickly followed by another attack on the following tick. This is a useful tactic for dealing high amounts of unexpected damage in PvP scenarios. In terms of long-term damage per second, initiating combat with the special attack is one tick less efficient than using the special attack while on cooldown between normal attack cycles.",

    "effect": "The granite maul's special attack , Quick Smash , consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and deals an instant attack. With the handle added, the special attack can result in two or three hits in a very short amount of time, making it a popular choice for player killing . If the three hits are timed correctly, the granite maul can kill instantly. However, one drawback is that unlike most special attacks, Quick Smash does not increase accuracy. It is commonly used in the Nightmare Zone in conjunction with the Power surge power-up. Because Quick Smash can be performed rapidly under the effect of Power surge, the granite maul is able to put out more total damage than other special attacks for as long as the power-up is active. The granite maul's special attack has a feature where, for 5 ticks after attacking a target with any weapon, activating the granite maul's special attack while next to that target will automatically attack it without clicking to do so. Clicking the special attack bar toggles the activation and reactivation of this feature, so clicking the special attack bar twice, for example, will disable the automatic attack. Clicking on the special attack bar twice does not disable the granite maul special attack. Rather, it initiates a 3 tick timer during which clicking on an opponent (or clicking the special attack bar a third time while next to an opponent one has attacked within 5 ticks) will cause two special attacks to occur if possible, or one if it is not. Once it has been activated, a granite maul special attack can only be disabled by taking off the weapon, or waiting out this 3 tick timer. The game displays a warning when the player initiates combat with a granite maul special attack, calling it wasteful. However, the special attack does not give the player any attack cooldown, regardless of if it was used to initiate combat or not. This means that initiating combat with a granite maul special attack can be quickly followed by another attack on the following tick.

[1] Chainhit can only ricochet to other enemies in a multicombat area . This special attack can target up to 5 opponents, but a rune thrownaxe will not rebound back to its original target after chaining to another enemy. [2] Furthermore, an accuracy roll is made after each target hit by the thrownaxe, which will end the sequence if failed. [3] Each hit consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy, i.e. three hits consumes 30% energy. This special attack uses a custom form of damage calculation that does not take into account offensive Prayers (such as Eagle Eye ) when determining a player's maximum Ranged hit . [4] In addition, the attack speed of Chainhit is one tick slower than the rune thrownaxe's regular attack, meaning the attack interval is 5 ticks (3.0s) on the rapid style, and 6 ticks (3.6s) on accurate or longrange. The following formula can be used to calculate the max hit of Chainhit : Maximum Hit = \u230a 0 . 5 + ( Visible Ranged Level + 1 0 ) * ( Ammo Ranged Strength + 6 4 ) 6 4 0 \u230b [a] [b] [c] [d] ^ Only the player's visible ranged level matters. Boosts given through prayers and Void Knight armour are ignored. ^ A stance bonus of 10 is used regardless of attack style used. ^ The ranged strength bonus of the player's armour and gear is ignored. Only the ranged strength bonus of the player's ammo is used. In the case of Rune thrownaxes, the weapon's ranged strength is used instead. ^ The bonus damage usually provided by wearing a Slayer helmet (i), Salve amulet (i) or Salve amulet (ei) is ignored.",

    "effect": "The Saradomin godsword has a special attack called Healing Blade , which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. When used, the player's max hit is increased by 10%, their accuracy is doubled, and Hitpoints and Prayer Points are restored equal to 50% and 25% of the damage dealt respectively, rounded up in even intervals. This effect only occurs on a successful hit, and any hit below 22 damage will always heal the player for 10 Hitpoints and restore 5 Prayer points. Healing Blade rolls against the opponent's slash defence roll. The Prayer and Life leech from Healing Blade is calculated from the potential damage of a swing before some types of damage immunities are applied. This can allow it to restore health and prayer even if a monster appears to take zero damage. For example, kurasks can only be harmed by leaf-bladed weaponry, broad bolts , or the Magic Dart spell, but if Healing Blade would have otherwise hit a 40 before immunity, the restoration effect still takes place and heals the player for 20 hitpoints and restores 10 prayer points. This mechanic also applies if the target has less total health than the potential damage of a swing. If a target with only 2 hitpoints remaining is struck with a Healing Blade that would have dealt 60 damage, the player will still be healed for the full amount of 30 hitpoints and have 15 prayer points restored. The maximum health and prayer points restored from the special attack depend on a player's maximum hit. For example a player with max strength , wearing a salve amulet (e) , and attacking an undead creature on the aggressive style while praying Piety and drinking a super strength potion could potentially hit for 80 damage. This would heal 40 hitpoints and restore 20 prayer points.",

The special attack will only drain the opponent's Magic level if it is not already reduced; consecutive use of Soulshot or Accursed Sceptre special attacks will have zero effect on their magic level until the stat has been fully restored, at which point it may be reapplied.

The following formula can be used to calculate the max hit of Soulshot : Maximum Hit = \u230a 0 . 5 + (Visible Ranged Level + 1 0 ) * ( Ammo Ranged Strength + 6 4 ) 6 4 0 \u230b [a] ^ A stance bonus of 10 is used regardless of attack style used.",

    "weapon_name": "Soulreaper axe",
    "effect": "The Soulreaper axe has a special attack , Behead , which consumes all Soul Stacks. This attack does not cost special attack energy and can be used as long as the player has at least one Soul stack. For each Soul Stack consumed, Behead increases the player's accuracy and damage by 6% and heals them by 8 Hitpoints, effectively restoring any health spent to create those Soul stacks. Players are healed regardless of whether the attack was a successful hit or not. If a player is at full health and has active Soul stacks they can utilise them as a temporary health bank; using Behead to restore up to 40 hitpoints instantly when needed. Although the in-game description states Behead deals additional damage, the special attack's increased accuracy is the only significant benefit. This is because the Strength boost from Soul stacks is consumed first and a separate bonus is applied to the swing at a different stage in the damage calculation. This typically results in Behead dealing similar maximum hits as a player that continues to auto attack with the Soul stack boost active. It's unknown if this is intentional behaviour at this time , as this can result in Behead dealing slightly less damage than an auto attack would otherwise in some situations. The accuracy roll for Behead uses the attack bonus of the player's currently selected style, which is rolled against the corresponding defensive bonuses of an opponent \u2013 either slash or crush in this case. [1] This is in contrast to most other special attacks, which roll against the defensive bonuses of an opponent of a specific combat style regardless of the attacking combat style chosen (for example, the dragon dagger 's special attack will always roll against the opponent's slash defence, even if the attack style is set to stab). Equipping the Soulreaper axe replaces the special attack interface with a unique graphic that indicates the Soul stack resource, however player's special attack energy continues to regenerate in the background normally. Since the special attack only consumes Soul stacks, it's useful to combo Behead into special attacks from other weapons. Some notable examples being the dragon warhammer to reduce an enemy's stats, or weapons like the granite maul for high amounts of burst damage.",

The special attack does not consume runes. When calculating the max hit, Immolate acts like any other spell. The spell's max hit is calculated first and then rounded down (known in mathematics as \"floor\"). All magic damage gear, including the +15% from the staff is calculated separately. Because the staff has a magic damage bonus, the max hit seen in-game will always be higher than the spell's max hit. The max hit varies with visible Magic level according to the formula below. [1] The spell's max hit is limited to, at most, 58. This means that even though the max hit is based on the player's magic level, boosting above magic level 98 will not increase the max hit. It can be increased though by using additional magic damage gear including the Slayer helmet (i) when on a slayer task . Spell Max Hit = min \u2061 { \u230a 5 8 * Magic Level 9 9 + 1 \u230b , 5 8 } Staff Max Hit = \u230a Spell Max Hit * 1 . 1 5 \u230b",

    "weapon_name": "Zamorak godsword",
    "effect": "The Zamorak godsword has a special attack , Ice Cleave , which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. It doubles the player's accuracy (slash or crush roll) and increases their max hit by 10%. In addition, it freezes the target in place for 19.2 seconds (32 ticks ); the same duration as Ice Barrage . The sword's special attack must produce a successful hit in order to have the freezing effect, and it rolls against opponent's slash defence. Protect from Melee only gives a damage reduction of 40% and does not affect the freeze. While its unique special attack may provide less utility than all other Godswords for the majority of situational uses, (e.g. it doesn't restore depleted stats, deplete opponent's stats, or deal any additional maximum damage relative to the other godswords), it is useful in numerous niche situations. It is very popular in the Castle Wars minigame when used to freeze flag-bearers, as such players generally wear equipment with high Magic defence bonus, such as black dragonhide , Karil's leathertop , and/or Armadyl armour in order to more easily defend against enemy mages casting Ancient Magicks (or Snare / Entangle with the standard spellbook). The use of this common strategy of possessing high magic defence bonus equipment, coupled with the game's particular magic defence -determining mechanics (that ultimately benefit accounts with higher levels in magic than defence), reliably renders magic-based freezing methods consistently ineffective. The Zamorak godsword's melee-based special attack is often used to undermine this tactic. In the Wilderness , it can also be used to freeze an enemy in place in order to attack from a distance, escape, or provide a more diversified (and therefore reliable) freezing strategy for clans; a useful tactic in Single-way combat is logging out while standing under a recently frozen enemy, as they will not unfreeze in time to retaliate. The Zamorak godsword has also found use in player-vs-monster situations. It is a popular weapon when fighting the Muttadiles , as it can stop them long enough from going to the meat tree to heal. It can also be used during the Barrows minigame to freeze the melee-using brothers in place, particularly Dharok the Wretched . The special attack animation 's colours can be changed to gold, which costs 75 Last Man Standing points. Once unlocked, the gold trim can be toggled at Justine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing whenever the player desires.",
